# Distance-Measurer-using-vPYTHON-
This is a simple project, which measures distance of an obstacle and displays it graphically .

Hardware Used: 1. Arduino UNO R3 Microcontroller board
               2. Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04
               3. Connecting Wires
               4. BreadBoard
Software Used: 1.Arduino IDE
               2. VIDLE for Vpython
               3. Vpython Library
               
The arduino code consists of the code for measuring the distance with an ultrasonic sensor. The ultrasonic sensor prints the distance over a serial port. The serial port data is read by python programming language, and a cylinder object is created using the Vpython library. Then, The distance is visually displayed as a bar in the cylinder object.
